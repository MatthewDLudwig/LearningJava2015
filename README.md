# LearningJava2015
15 Lessons I created a while back in order to teach someone Java.  They still apply well, and are written as if I were lecturing on the subject matter.  They are edited for Github viewing but there are very few content changes to keep it accurate to when I wrote it.  I believe I only added a sentence in one of the lessons while formatting them to readme.md in order to make what I meant more obvious.

Starts with a slow intro into Java through the first half but by the end covers most of Java 8; as at the time I myself was still learning the new features.  For preservations sake I haven't changed anything **content wise** (excluding 1 or 2 places to improve clarity) but I may make a 16th lesson at some point.

Originally the lessons were all just java file inside an eclipse project we sent back and forth, with the lessons as a giant block comment at the top of the file.  This format has been preserved for the first lesson only to improve legibility.
