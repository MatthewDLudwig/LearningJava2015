# LearningJava2015
15 Lessons I created a while back in order to teach someone Java.  They still apply well, and are written as if I were lecturing on the subject matter.  Edited for Github viewing but no content changes.

Starts with a slow into intro into Java through the first half, but by the end covers most of Java 8 as at the time I myself was still learning the new features.  For preservations sake I haven't changed anything **content wise** but I may make a 16th addendum lesson at some point.

Originally the lessons were all just java file inside an eclipse project we sent back and forth, with the lessons as a giant block comment at the top of the file.  This format has been preserved for the first lesson only to improve legibility.
