# LearningJava2015
15 Lessons I created a while back in order to teach someone Java.  They still apply well, and are written as if I were lecturing on the subject matter.  Edited for Github viewing but no content changes.

Starts with a slow into into Java through the first half, but by the end covers most of Java 8 as at the time I myself was still familiarlizing myself with it.  For preservations sake I haven't changed anything but I may make a 16th addendum lesson at some point.
