# LearningJava2015
15 Lessons I created while in school in order to teach someone Java.  They still apply well, and are written as if I were lecturing on the subject matter.  They are edited for Github viewing but there are very few content changes to keep it accurate to when I wrote it.  I believe I only added a sentence in one of the lessons while formatting them to readme.md in order to make what I meant more obvious.

Starts with a slow intro into Java through the first half but by the end covers most of Java 8; as at the time I myself was still learning the new features.  For preservations sake I haven't changed anything **content wise** (excluding 1 or 2 places to improve clarity) but I may make a 16th lesson at some point.

Originally the lessons were all just java files inside an eclipse project we sent back and forth, with the lessons as a giant block comment at the top of the file.  This format has been preserved for the first lesson only to improve legibility.

The first 10 lessons were given as one part and the last 5 as another.  When I gave the last 5 to the student, I also converted lessons 8 - 10 into separate files for each object.  This conversion has only been kept for lesson 10 so as to not hit you with separate files too quickly.
