## The Lesson

 * Welcome to the wonderful world of Java!
	 * In order to learn correctly you should read this whole file over.
		 * That means you should read the comments above each method.
			 * Thats what this text is.
			 * You can make comments by using // if you are writing a comment on only one line.
			 * If you need multiple lines you can use what I am using now but I can not write it out or else it breaks this comment.
		 * That means you should look at and understand every example program (what is within the method).
			 * A method is something like "public static void main(String[] tuna)" which is a very special method.
				 * Another example of a method is public void METHODNAME() which is how all of these lessons are named.
		 * That means you should run every example program and understand how the code you read translates to what you see.
			 * This is done by using the object I have created for you in the method below and changing what comes after the dot (.).
			 * lessons.lessonOne() should be changed to lessons.lessonTwo() for lesson two and lessons.lessonThree() for lesson three.
				 * I think you can figure it out from there.  As a hint you make what comes after the dot the lesson name.
		 * Don't worry too much about methods and objects for now it is just unfortunately the easiest way for me to teach you in this form.
		 * I encourage you to use your test project not just for the assignments but also for messing around with everything you learn in each tutorial.
			 * Try to learn through doing and seeing interesting combinations of concepts as I will not show you them all (at least for now).
 * And now time for your first lesson:
	 * If you haven't been able to tell, all lessons are structured the way that this and the welcome message above are.
		 * It is sort of like a bulleted list!
	 * Basics of methods:
		 * Declaration (public static void NAME(PARAMETERS))
			 * public is a keyword used to define the scope of a method.
				 * This keyword is also used in many different places in Java code.
				 * For now just know that all of your methods will use the public keyword.
			 * static is a special keyword that we will be ignoring for now.
				 * Just know that it is only necessary for the main method below.
			 * void is a keyword that means the function will not be returning anything.
				 * In place of void you could put the return type but we will not be dealing with that for now.
			 * NAME is the name of the method and what will be used to identify it.
			 * PARAMETERS is a list of all things that will be passed into a method.
				 * Think of it as the things that the method knows even before it starts up.
				 * For now all methods except the main method will have no parameters.
		 * Methods also have a body which is what going inside of the curly braces that comes after the declaration of a method.
			 * The body of a method is where all of your logic for your program will go.
	 * The main method:
		 * The main method is a special method that is present within every Java program.
		 * It is the method that Java looks for when starting your program and will be where your program will start.
		 * Nothing can be done unless you wish it to and do something to make it happen in the main method.
		 * The parameters that are passed into the main method are usually called args but for the example's sake I have called them tuna.
			 * This is to show that they can be named anything you wish.
			 * You will not be using this parameter in the near future so I will not be going into it for now or possibly at all.
				 * If you ever wish to use it just use www.google.com and learn about it.
	 * Note:
		 * Keep in mind that none of these lessons will do you any good if you just read them to get it over with.
		 * You should read them and reread them until you are sure you know the topics although leave time between rereadings so that you don't get overworked.
		 * You will always have these lessons so you can look back and refresh on topics
			 * Everything I teach you should be something that sticks with you and not something you always have to look up.
		 * But occasional looking up is fine, all programmers do it.  We are all human, we forget things.

## The Program

 * This is a program that you will be changing to fit your needs when you need to run a specific lesson.
 * In order to change which lesson you are on just change the method being called from the lessons object.
	 * l.lessonOne() is lesson one which you start on and to change to lesson 4 make it l.lessonFour()

## The Assignment

 * Every so often there will be an assignment.
	 * They will probably come more often as we get farther into our learning.
 * Don't do them in this project but instead in your own project with your own classes.
 * They will never be impossible and will use information that has been taught or has been previously taught.
	 * I will make sure that you do not forget old topics and will often have you use certain techniques in order to force you to recall them.
